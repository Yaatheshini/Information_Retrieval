**Do not write documentation here -- TAs will not read this file during grading.**

# What is this folder for?

This is the folder where you must store files containing the data structures that your `read_XYZ.py` programs create and that your `print_XYZ.py` programs consume.

### Naming convention

Each file should have the same name (prior to extension) as the corresponding test collection. 

The extensions of those files cannot be the same as in the `./collections/` folder, to avoid confusion/errors.
