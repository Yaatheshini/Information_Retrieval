# What is this folder for?

This is the folder where you must store the file containing the term-document incidence matrices and any other data structures from the raw collection files that your programs read and consume.

### Naming convention

Each file should have the same name (prior to extension) as the corresponding test collection. 

The term-document incidence matrix file must be a JSON file and have extension `.matrix.json`.

The extensions of those files cannot be the same as in the `./collections/` folder, to avoid confusion/errors.
